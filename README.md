# Gang of Four Design Patterns -- a more functional-programming approach

Inspired by [Mario Fusco's](https://twitter.com/mariofusco) attempt
([github repo](https://github.com/mariofusco/from-gof-to-lambda))
to describe the canonical implementation of design patterns from the
[Gang of Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) book to 
a more functional-programming approach.

This is my own personal take to practice getting more comfortable composing
functions when it feels more natural than the class-oriented, traditional way.

This exercise is using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) which supports a lot
of properties from both OOP and FP paradigms.

## Theme of exercise
There are two files per pattern, one with the object-oriented approach,
and another with the functional approach. Both of the takes model 
the same problem but solve it differently. There is a simple `main`
for each file that roughly tests each approach in isolation.

Currently, we only include  **_Strategy_** and **_Visitor_** patterns.

_More to come..._ :slightly_smiling_face:
